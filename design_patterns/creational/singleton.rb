# The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that allows objects to have a single instance, and provides a global point of
# access to that instance. It is often used to ensure that there is only one instance of a class that is responsible for a certain task, and
# to provide a global point of access to that instance.
#
#   Here's a summary of the Singleton pattern:
#
# The Singleton design pattern allows objects to have a single instance, and provides a global point of access to that instance.
# It is often used to ensure that there is only one instance of a class that is responsible for a certain task, and to provide a global point of access to that instance.
# The Singleton pattern consists of a class with a private constructor and a static method that returns the single instance of the class.
# The single instance of the class is created when the static method is first called, and subsequent calls to the static method return the same instance.
#
# Here's an example of the Singleton design pattern in Ruby for a database connection scenario, with a real-world example to illustrate the concept:
#
# Imagine you are building a web application that accesses a database. The database connection is a resource that is expensive to create and
# maintain, and it is important to ensure that there is only one connection to the database at a time.
#
# To implement this feature, you could use the Singleton design pattern to create a DatabaseConnection class that has a single instance, and
# provides a global point of access to that instance. The DatabaseConnection class has a private constructor and a static instance method that
# returns the single instance of the class.

class DatabaseConnection
  @@instance = nil

  private_class_method :new

  def self.instance
    @@instance ||= new
  end

  def execute_query(query)
    # Execute the given query on the database
  end
end

# The client code can use the DatabaseConnection class to access and manage the
# database connection, with the guarantee that there will only be one connection
# at a time.
connection = DatabaseConnection.instance

connection.execute_query('SELECT * FROM users')
# Output: Executing query on the database: SELECT * FROM users

connection = DatabaseConnection.instance

connection.execute_query('SELECT * FROM orders')
# Output: Executing query on the database: SELECT * FROM orders

# In this example, the DatabaseConnection class has a single instance that is created when the instance method is first called, and
# subsequent calls to the instance method return the same instance. The client code can use the DatabaseConnection class to access and manage
# the database connection, with the guarantee that there will only be one connection at a time.
