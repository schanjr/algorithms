#   Here's a summary of the Proxy pattern:
#
# The Proxy design pattern allows objects to act as surrogates for other objects.
# It is often used to provide a simplified interface to complex or resource-intensive objects, or to delay the creation of expensive objects
# until they are actually needed.
# The Proxy pattern consists of a proxy class that acts as an intermediary between the client and the real object.
# The proxy class has the same interface as the real object, and forwards requests from the client to the real object.
#
# Here's an example of the Proxy design pattern in Ruby for a remote file system scenario, with a real-world example to illustrate the concept:
#
# Imagine you are building a file system application that allows users to access and manage files on a remote server. The file system on the
# remote server is very large and complex, and accessing it directly can be slow and resource-intensive.
#
# To improve the performance of the file system application, you could use the Proxy design pattern to create a RemoteFileSystemProxy class that
# acts as an intermediary between the client and the real file system on the remote server. The RemoteFileSystemProxy class has the same interface
# as the real file system, and forwards requests from the client to the real file system, but it also caches frequently accessed files locally to
# improve performance.

# The RemoteFileSystem class represents the real file system on the remote server.
# It has a read_file method that retrieves a file from the file system.
class RemoteFileSystem
  def read_file(path)
    puts "Reading file from remote file system: #{path}"
    # Return contents of file at the given path
  end
end

# The RemoteFileSystemProxy class represents a proxy for the real file system on
# the remote server. It has a cache attribute that stores a hash of recently
# accessed files, and a read_file method that retrieves a file from the file
# system or from the cache if the file has been recently accessed.
class RemoteFileSystemProxy
  def initialize
    @cache = {}
    @file_system = RemoteFileSystem.new
  end

  def read_file(path)
    if @cache.key?(path)
      puts "Reading file from cache: #{path}"
      @cache[path]
    else
      puts "Reading file from remote file system: #{path}"
      file_contents = @file_system.read_file(path)
      @cache[path] = file_contents
      file_contents
    end
  end
end

# The client code can use the RemoteFileSystemProxy class to access and manage
# files on the remote file system, with improved performance due to caching.
file_system = RemoteFileSystemProxy.new

# with improved performance due to caching.
file_system.read_file('/path/to/file1')
# Output: Reading file from cache: /path/to/file1

file_system.read_file('/path/to/file2')
# Output:

# In this example, the RemoteFileSystemProxy class acts as a proxy for the RemoteFileSystem class, providing a simplified interface to the file
# system on the remote server. It also implements caching to improve the performance of the file system application.
#
# The client code can use the RemoteFileSystemProxy class to access and manage files on the remote file system, and it will receive the benefits
# of the proxy pattern, including improved performance due to caching.
