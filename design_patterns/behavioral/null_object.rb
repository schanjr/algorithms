# The Null Object design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to provide a default object as a substitute for a missing object.
# It is often used to handle null values in applications, and can help to reduce conditional statements and improve code readability.
#
# Here's a summary of the Null Object pattern:
#
# The Null Object pattern allows you to provide a default object as a substitute for a missing object.
# It is often used to handle null values in applications, and can help to reduce conditional statements and improve code readability.
# The Null Object pattern consists of a base class and one or more derived classes.
# The base class defines the interface for the object, and the derived classes implement the interface with different behavior.
# The base class also includes a null object class that provides a default implementation of the interface.
# Here's an example of the Null Object design pattern in Ruby for a customer service scenario, with a real-world example to illustrate the concept:
#
# Imagine you are building a customer service application that allows customers to request assistance from a customer service representative.
# The application allows customers to choose a specific representative to help them, or to choose a default representative if no specific
# representative is available.
#
# To implement this functionality, you could use the Null Object design pattern to provide a default customer service representative as a substitute
# for a missing representative.
# The CustomerServiceRepresentative class represents a customer service
# representative. It has a name attribute that stores the name of the
# representative, and a help method that provides assistance to the customer.
class CustomerServiceRepresentative
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def help
    puts "Hello, my name is #{name} and I am here to help you."
  end
end

# The NullCustomerServiceRepresentative class represents a null customer service
# representative. It has a name attribute that stores the name of the
# representative, and a help method that does nothing.
class NullCustomerServiceRepresentative < CustomerServiceRepresentative
  def help
  end
end

# The CustomerService class represents a customer service. It has a
# representative attribute that stores the customer service representative, and a
# request_assistance method that allows the customer to request assistance from
# the representative.
class CustomerService
  attr_accessor :representative

  def request_assistance
    representative.help
  end
end

# The client code can use the CustomerService, CustomerServiceRepresentative, and
# NullCustomerServiceRepresentative classes to request assistance from a customer
# service representative.
customer_service = CustomerService.new

customer_service.representative = CustomerServiceRepresentative.new('Alice')
customer_service.request_assistance

# Output:
# Hello, my name is Alice and I am here to help you.

customer_service.representative = NullCustomerServiceRepresentative.new('Bob')
customer_service.request_assistance

# Output:
# (nothing)


# the CustomerServiceRepresentative class represents a customer service representative, and has a name attribute that stores the name of the
# representative, and a help method that provides assistance
#
# the NullCustomerServiceRepresentative class represents a null customer service representative, and has a name attribute that stores the name of
# the representative, and a help method that does nothing. This allows the CustomerService class to use the NullCustomerServiceRepresentative as a
# default object when no specific representative is available, without having to use conditional statements to check for a missing representative.
#
# The Null Object design pattern is a useful pattern for handling null values in applications, and can help to reduce conditional statements and
# improve code readability. It is particularly useful when working with objects that may not always be present, such as optional dependencies or
# external resources.
