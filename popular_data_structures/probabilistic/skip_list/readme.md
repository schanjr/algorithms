- SkipList is great for multi threaded environments where the value can be 
accessed without being blocked.
- Inserts can be done dynamically without re-referencing multiples nodes such as the case when balancing trees 
- Skiplist by default is sorted. 
- When there is a need of using Binary Search Trees, prefer skip list.
