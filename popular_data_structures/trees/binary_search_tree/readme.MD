## Binary Search Tree
- Binary Tree = A tree that has two children
- Sorted Tree = The smallest value node is all the way on the left. The largest value node is all the way on the right. Nodes on the same level should be from small to big
Descendents of the left side of the node is smaller. Descendents on the right side of the node should be bigger

Binary Tree + Sorted Tree = Binary Search Tree
