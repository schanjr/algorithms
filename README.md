# Generate and View Documentations (in-progress)
- Still experimenting. I like that it generates docs and makes navigation easier if you don't have
an editor, but it also makes the code messy. 
- See ex: `popular_algorithms/dynamic_programming/min_difficulty_job_schedule.rb:15`
```bash 
rake doc
open doc/index.html
```
